Web Literacy Standard
=====================
*(specification)*

Where do you go if you want to get better at your web skills? How do you even know what's important to learn? The Web Literacy Standard comprises a map of competencies and skills that Mozilla and our community of stakeholders believe are important to pay attention to when getting better at reading, writing and participating on the web. The Web Literacy Standard is part of Mozilla’s ongoing goal to create a generation of webmakers – those who can not only elegantly consume but also write and *participate* on the web. 

=====================

The Web Literacy Standard (specification) is comprised of three strands:

* **Exploring** - navigating the web
* **Building** - creating for the web
* **Connecting** - participating on the web
